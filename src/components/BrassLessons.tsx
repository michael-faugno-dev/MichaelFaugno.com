      <h1>Private Brass Lessons</h1>
      <p>
        Looking to improve your trumpet or brass playing? I offer private lessons for students of all ages and skill levels in the North Jersey and New York Metro area. Whether you're preparing for auditions, developing fundamentals, or just beginning your musical journey, lessons are tailored to each student's individual goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        In-person lessons are available locally, and I also offer convenient Zoom sessions for remote students across the country. My approach combines strong fundamentals with engaging, practical exercises to build confidence, range, and musicality.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in lessons or would like to inquire about availability and rates, feel free to reach out via the contact form or any of the social icons above and below.
